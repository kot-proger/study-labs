         The TORA software is written for the IBM/PC/XT/AT and true
         compatible.  It requires 512K RAM and MS-DOS 3.2 or higher.  The
         software uses the notation and procedures developed in:
         TAHA, H., OPERATIONS RESEARCH:AN INTRODUCTION, 6/e, Prentice Hall,
         1997.

         TORA can be executed from the floppy drive (a: or b:) or from the
         hard disk (c:).  A hard disk is recommended.

         DISKETTE CONTENTS:
         readme.doc
         tora.exe
         11 example-data files (*.or) taken from OPERATIONS RESEARCH 6/e

         INSTALLATION ON HARD DISK:
         Make a separate directory named TORA (or any other name of your
         choice) and copy all the contents of this diskette into the
         created directory.

         STEP-BY-STEP HARD DISK INSTALLATION:
         1.  Turn on the computer.
         2.  Make new directory named TORA:  At the DOS prompt C:>, type
                 md TORA
             and press ENTER (or RETURN) key.
         3.  At the DOS prompt C:>, type
                 cd TORA
             and press ENTER.
         4.  Place the TORA diskette in the 3.5" (or 5.25") drive (A or B).
         5.  At the DOS prompt C:\TORA>, type
                 copy a:\TORA\*.*   (if diskette is in drive A)
                 copy b:\TORA\*.*   (if diskette is in drive B)
             and press ENTER.
         6.  The installation is now complete.

         EXECUTION:
         To execute TORA from the directory in which it is installed, type
         TORA and then press ENTER.  The software is totally menu driven
         and hence requires no instruction manual.

         The first time you execute TORA, you will be asked if you are
         using a color monitor.  The answer to this question (y or n) is
         automatically stored in the TORA working directory in a file named
         COLOR.COD.  If you wish to change the color mode, simply erase the
         file COLOR.COD by using the DOS command ERASE COLOR.COD.

         TESTING:
         TORA has a total of 8 modules:

           Linear programming
           Transportation
           Networks
           Integer programming
           Queueing
           Histogramming/forecasting
           Inventory

         Each module (with the exception of INVENTORY) has one or more
         example models stored in files with obvious descriptive names
         suffixed with .OR (e.g., LP.OR is a linear programming model).
         All the examples are taken from the textbook.  These files follow
         a special format created by the TORA editor and may be accessed by
         entering the file name at the proper prompt from TORA.  The list
         of file names may also be accessed by entering *.OR for the file
         name or simply by pressing ENTER.  In this case, a directory will
         be displayed and the desired file is chosen by moving the reverse
         video bar to the proper location and then pressing ENTER.  All
         modules accept the entry of new problems through the use of a
         custom-tailored editor.  The commands of the special editor will
         be displayed at the top of the edit screen at all times during the
         editing session.
